 *
 *
 * A median is only defined on ordered one-dimensional data, and is independent of any distance metric.
 * A geometric median, on the other hand, is defined in any number of dimensions.Also a median can be
 * regarded the "middle number" in a set of values and in the case of having even number of values such
 * as (3,4,5,6) the median will be the two middle values added together and divided by 2, [ i.e (4+5)/2 ]
